# Services

## Overview
Services form the core of the application's business logic implementation, providing a structured approach to handling complex operations and data management.

## Service Architecture

### Location and Structure
Services are organized within the `app/services` directory, following a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes code reusability.

### Integration with Routes
Services are primarily utilized within route handlers to implement business logic. For instance:
- The `app/routes/_index.tsx` route employs the `AuthService` for authentication management
- Route-specific business logic is encapsulated within corresponding services

### Server-Side Implementation
Services are designed as server-side components, with the following considerations:
- Services cannot be directly accessed from React components
- This design aligns with RemixJS's server/client rendering architecture
- Service methods are exclusively called within route loader or action functions
